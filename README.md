# MongoDB UpdateOne with $push and $sort Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error related to the use of the `$sort` modifier within the `$push` operator in MongoDB's `updateOne` method.  The issue arises from a misunderstanding of how `$sort` behaves in this context. While `$sort` is intended to order elements, it's not guaranteed to work consistently when used directly inside `$push`. The actual order of the elements in the updated array might be unpredictable.

## Bug Description:
The provided `bug.js` example shows the incorrect use of `$sort` within `$push`. The expectation is that the inserted elements will be sorted according to `someField`; however, this is not guaranteed to be the case. This can lead to unexpected behavior in applications that rely on the order of elements in the array.

## Solution:
The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates a better way to maintain the correct order. This involves using an approach which sorts the array before performing the `$push` operation, ensuring predictable behavior.
